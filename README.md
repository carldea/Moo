# Moo: Mapping Objects to Objects

It's not uncommon to need to do some mapping from one object model to another, whether that's
_data transfer objects_, an _anti-corruption layer_, or something else.  Two projects I've been on
have written code similar to this, and I thought it was time to start re-using rather than
building from scratch.
